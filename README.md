# Memory Card game using Flutter

This is a simple game of memory. There are 3 difficulty levels. The app has 4 screens, including start, level select, game and result. Results are stored so passed levels are remembered.

### Responsiveness

The UI is responsive, and the number of cards loaded per row and their size is dynamically defined for each device based on screen size. Appropiate padding is done. There is also a click/tab lock that prevents the user from turning mroe than one pair of cards at a time. This helps avoid bugs.


The app works well and meets all defined project evaluation criteria.
